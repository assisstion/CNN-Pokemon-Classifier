# Pokemon Type Classifier
This project aims to classify pokemon types given an pokemon image using convolutional neural networks.

# Dataset
The image dataset comes from [veekun](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads) containing pokemon sprite images from games spanning Generation I to V, as well as icons, Global-Link artwork, and the spinoff Pokemon Conquest.

The pokemon stat and type data comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) and contains id, stats, type, and legendary status information on all the pokemon to date.
